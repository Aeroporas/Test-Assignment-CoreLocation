# Test-Assignment-CoreLocation
This test assignment was completed in June 2021 for a geo startup. Although it was accepted, we couldn't come to an agreement on salary.

I took this assignment (I usually don't) since the task was interesting for me because I wanted to dive into CoreLocation background modes for a long time already and it will be a nice feature for my pet project.
This repo represents my approach to creating an app on an idea given in general description without any clarifications.

What I've learned during this assignment:
* While in background device is expected to receive notification updates when user moves 500m or more as per Apple documentation, so you barely can use that approach for exact location appliances. 
* Flickr API is pretty cumbersome
* JSONP format exsists 

What can be improved in this project:
* Introduce CoreData (now it's all in memory)
* Play with accuracy to reduce energy consumption
* Introduce algorithm to filter out photo duplicates

The text of an assignment is presented below.
